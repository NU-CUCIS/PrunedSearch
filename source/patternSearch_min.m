function [bestOpt, bestOdf] = patternSearch_min(fhandle)

%This function calls global optimization tool patternsearch to perform optimization
%   Since the pattern search algorithm requires a starting point (odf0), in
%   this program we enumerate different starting points incrementally,
%   firstly with a relatively wide interval (10). After the initial best
%   starting point is found, additional searches are done by refining the
%   interval to a smaller value (1).
%   Note that the starting point does NOT have to meet the constraint.
%
%The function patternsearch initially deals with minimization, in order to
%   transform it into maximization, firstly the fhandle gives the negative
%   of what we really want, and secondly, we change it back after obtaining
%   it.

%INPUT: 
% fhandle: function handle of the function to be minimized
%   for example, patternSearch_min(@materialOpt)

%OUTPUTS:
% bestOpt: the maximum property obtained 
% bestOdf: the ODF ( or ODFs if size(bestOdf,1)>1 ) that leads to maximal
%   property
